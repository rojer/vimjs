# VimJS - a JavaScript helper script for Vim.

VimJS parses .js files and adds scope-aware variable highlighting and basic refactoring (just renaming a varible for now).

VimJS uses a JavaScript parser from the [slimit JS minifier](https://github.com/rspivak/slimit) (you'll need [my patched version](https://github.com/rojer/slimit)).
